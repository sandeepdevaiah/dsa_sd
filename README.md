# 🧠 DSA Practice Repo

This repo contains my practice problems, algorithms, and data structure implementations.  
Focused on mastering patterns for interviews (LeetCode, Uber, LinkedIn, Google).

## Structure
- `algorithms/`: Sorting, searching, recursion, etc.
- `data_structures/`: Core DSA implementations.
- `problems/`: Solved problems organized by difficulty or company.

## Run
```bash
python problems/easy/two_sum.py
